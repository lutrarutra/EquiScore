# EquiScore
Deep Graph Convolution Based Model to Predict Ligand-Protein Binding Affinity.

EquiScore uses EquiBind's [1] protein and ligand graph representations to predict binding affinity (Kd, Ki, IC50). Graph model is constructed using DGL and PyTorch.
This project is part of university course project.
